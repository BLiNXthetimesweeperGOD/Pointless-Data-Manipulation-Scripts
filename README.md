# Pointless-Data-Manipulation-Scripts
A bunch of scripts that I've made which pointlessly manipulate files and data. If any of these end up being used in a project, please credit me as "Dr. RNG".

# What each script does
StringEncrypt.py acts as a library of sorts that can encrypt input strings. I also included an example within the script which writes to a file that can be used later.
NSPK_PACK.py generates a Name-Scaled Package file. It's very buggy and happens to be one of my earlier scripts, so use it at your own risk!
NSPK_UNPACK.py unpacks an NSPK file.
